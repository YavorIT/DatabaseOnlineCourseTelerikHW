XML - Extensible markup language.
Represents data and the way it is stored. XML is used to make a scheme or something to describe the data in both human-readable
and machine-readable form. IT is mainly used for the interchange of data over the internet.
XML is similar to HTML. They both are markup languages.
The difference is that XML is more flexible - it's tags are not predefined (you can name them whatever you want)  
and it is develope to describe data not web pages.
